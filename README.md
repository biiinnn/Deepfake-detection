# Deepfake-detection
2022 Spring - Project in ANN and DL Class - SeoulTech, Department of Data Science

## Main Idea
This project is aiming to investigate the effect of image change on Deepfake detection problem. Deepfake detection performance is compared using original (color) image, images with color changes, and images with changes in saturation.

### Data
We used Deepfake Detection Challenge dataset in Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/deepfake-detection-challenge/data

### Data Preprocessing
We did data preprocessing to make different type of video.
- Original video to black and white video
- Original video to high saturation video
